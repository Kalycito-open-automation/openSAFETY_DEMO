CMake {#page_cmake}
============

The openSAFETY_DEMO makes extensive use of the cross-platform, open-source
build system CMake.
This page provides information about the program and it's usage.

# Out-of-Source Builds {#sect_gs_cmake_buildsw_outofsource}

CMake support out-of-source builds. Therefore, all generated files are located
in a separate build directory which keeps your sources clean. The
openSAFETY_DEMO project already provides the folder `build` in the root
directory.

> **IMPORTANT:** If the **target platform** consists of several processors with
> **different architectures** a **second or third build folder may be created**
> by the user. This also applies when changing the kind of
> compilation (native, cross compilation) and different toolchain files.

# CMake usage {#sect_cmake}

There are different ways to generate build configurations with CMake.

## Command line {#sect_cmake_commandline}

CMake can be used directly from the command line. It is possible to select
the generator for different build systems and pass the CMake variable values.
Pass `-G "GENERATOR"` to CMake, where `GENERATOR` is one of the supported
generators of CMake.

- To list available command line options and generators, open a shell where
  the path to CMake is set and type

        > cmake --help

- To specify a value for a CMake variable pass `-D[YOUR_OPTION]=VALUE` on the
  command line. Refer to the sections **Target specific configuration option**
  throughout the documentation to view available options to pass to CMake.

- Inside the shell enter the build directory and execute CMake in the build
  directory with the path to the source directory as a parameter.

  Example:

        > cd build
        > cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain-arm-cortexm4-gnueabi.cmake \
        >       -DCFG_STM32_HAL_LIB_LOC=/c/dev/STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.10.0/ -DCFG_PROG_FLASH_ENABLE=ON \
        >       -DCFG_DUAL_CHANNEL=dual-channel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../

  The example above will generate Unix style Makefiles for the stm32f401 platform
  in a dual channelled configuration with the selected HAL library
  and enabled software download.

- After successful generation, change back to the shell. To list the
  available targets type

        > make help

- To build the desired target type

        > make TARGETNAME

  or type

        > make all

  for building all targets.

## cmake-gui {#sect_cmake_gui}

CMake also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting the
desired generator, toolchain file and settings:

- Open a shell where the path to CMake and the tools you want to use is set.
- Open the CMake GUI by typing

        > cmake-gui &

- Select the directory in which the source files are located.
  Also, select a build directory (must not be the source directory!)

  ![CMake GUI](cmake.png)
  @image latex cmake.png "CMake GUI"

- Click the button `Generate`
- Specify the generator and if you are building for the local machine
  (`Use default native compilers`) or cross compiling
  (`Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling`).

  ![CMake Generator and Compilation Selection](cmake_generator.png)
  @image latex cmake_generator.png "CMake Generator and Compilation Selection"

- When cross-compiling, select a toolchain-file from the demo's **cmake**
  directory.
- After first configuration, edit the settings shown by CMake GUI

  ![Newly added CMake Variables](cmake_settings.png)
  @image latex cmake_settings.png "Newly added CMake Variables"

- Click `Configure again`, new variables  may show up in red. If applicable,
  set the new variables to the desired value.
- Click `Generate`

  ![CMake Generation done](cmake_generation_done.png)
  @image latex cmake_generation_done.png "CMake Generation done"

- After successful generation, change back to the shell. To list the
  available targets type

        > make help

- To build the desired target type

        > make TARGETNAME

 or type

        > make all

 for building all targets.


# Target Platforms and Build Configuration  {#sect_gs_cmake_buildsw}

The following target platforms are supported, where not
all platforms always provide a full set of features.
Follow the referenced targets for information on hardware and software setup
and the procedure for building the bitstream and software respectively.

Target platforms used for executing parts of the openSAFETY_DEMO:
- \subpage page_gs_altnios2
- \subpage page_gs_stm32f103rb
- \subpage page_gs_stm32f401re


The following platform is used only for compiling and executing the PSI
unit tests:
- \subpage page_gs_x86


## Configuration Options {#sect_gs_cmake_options}

The following build configuration options are available to pass to **CMake** by
using the `-D` parameter or by enabling them in the graphical user interface:

> **Note:** When using `cmake-gui` check the boxes `Grouped` and `Advanced`
> to make visible all available options grouped by their names.
