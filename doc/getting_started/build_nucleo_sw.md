# Nucleo F103RB {#sect_build_nucleo_sw_f103}

This section provides information on how to build the software for the
**stm32f103rb** Nucleo board. The following steps need to be carried out
in order to do this:

1. Create a build environment with **bash** shell, the **GNU CoreUtils** and the
   **gcc-arm-none-eabi** compiler. (See \subpage page_install_software)
2. Inside the shell enter the build directory or create a new directory
   and change there.

   - Execute CMake in the build directory with the path to the source directory
     as a parameter.

     If passing other paths than the toolchain file and the source
     directory to **cmake**, make sure to use absolute paths.

            > cd build
            > cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain-arm-cortexm3-gnueabi.cmake \
            >       -DCFG_STM32_HAL_LIB_LOC=[PATH_TO_STM32Cube_FW_F1_V1.2.0] ../

     This will generate Unix style Makefiles for the stm32f103rb platform with
     the default configuration. See the section \ref sect_gs_cmake_options and
     \ref sect_gs_nucleo_buildsw_options_f103 for all available options which
     can be passed to CMake. Simply add `-D[YOUR_OPTION]` to the build
     command above.

   - Alternatively, execute `cmake-gui` to do the configuration via the
     graphical interface.

3. After CMake has finished generating the Makefiles it is possible to compile
   the software for your project. This can be done with the following command.

       > make all

4. After the build is finished it is possible to write the executable to the
   local flash memory. (e.g: DEMO_NAME=demo-sn-gpio-upm)
   Use `make help` to print all available make targets.

   >
   > * The boards have to be powered up **before** they are connected
   >  via USB to the computer.
   >
   > * When downloading software to the boards, it must to be ensured that

   >   the software must be started again.
   >   Erasing the flash can be done with STM32 ST-LINK Utility:
   >   `Target -> Erase chip` or with the button `Full chip erase`.

# Debugging the software on the Nucleo board   {#sect_gs_nucleo_buildsw_debug}
It is possible to debug the software using arm-none-eabi-gdb, the st-link tools
and the **Eclipse IDE**. With this you should be able to comfortably step
through the code and set breakpoints.

1. Set the CMake generator to: **Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles**
   - This will generate an additional Eclipse project with the standard
     Unix Makefiles.

2. Get Eclipse from https://eclipse.org
   - The Eclipse IDE needs to be started from a shell where the path is set
     to all tools needed to compile build and run the demos on an stm32.

3. Import generated CMake Eclipse project into the Eclipse IDE with:
   - File -> Import -> Existing Projects Into Workspace.
   - Set 'Select root directory' to the CMake build folder.
   - Select the found project and hit 'Finish'

4. Open a second shell start the tool **st-util**. This tool is a gdb server
   which enables you to connect with the gdb client (e.g: arm-none-eabi-gdb).
   The tool st-util listens on port 4242 with not set differently.

5. Define a new 'Debug Configuration' in Eclipse:
   - Run -> Debug Configuration -> C/C++ Remote Application
   - In the 'Main' tab select the **elf** file as an application.
   - In the 'Debugger' tab set the following:
     * GDB debugger = arm-none-eabi-gdb
     * Connection / Host = localhost
     * Connection / Port = 4242

6. \b -> Step through the code and find the bug!

> **Note:** If debugging isn't possible in the described way with
> C/C++ Remote Application Debug Configuration go to
> `Help -> Install New Software`.
> In the new window select the entry that matches your version of Eclipse
> e.g. "[VERSION] - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/[VERSION]" from the
> `Work with` drop down menu.
> Enter "hardware" in the filter text box and install
> `C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging` from the section
> `Mobile and Device Development`.
> Now a new Debug Configuration can be added (GDB Hardware Debugging):
> In the 'Main' tab select your .elf file you want to debug.
> In the 'Debugger' tab make the following settings:
> - GDB Command: arm-none-eabi-gdb
> - check use remote target checkbox
> - Host name or IP address: localhost
> - Port number: 4242

# Viewing the debug output of the Nucleo board {#sect_gs_nucleo_buildsw_debug_virtual_com}

When the software was built in `Debug` configuration, it is possible to view
the status / debug output of the openSAFETY_DEMO application processors:

- Connect the Nucleo board via USB to the computer
- Open a terminal program and open the virtual COM port related to the
  Nucleo board

The following settings are needed for the COM port:
- Port: Virtual COM port of the Nucleo board
- Baud rate: 115200
- Data: 8bit
- Paraity: none
- Stop: 1 bit
- Flow control: none

Depending on the used terminal program, it may be necessary to set the new-line
recognition to `\n` or `line feed` for correct view of the output.
