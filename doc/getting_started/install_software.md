## stlink tools {#sect_gs_install_software_stlinktools}

### Build stlink tools on Linux

- Make sure the following software is installed, if something is missing,
  the packages can be installed from the system's package manager:

   - libusb
   - automake
   - autoconf
   - pkg-config

- Get the stlink sources by downloading and extracting the source archive or
  obtain stlink via git:

       > git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git stlink-utility

- Change into the stlink source directory and compile stlink:

       > cd STLINK_DIR
       > ./autogen.sh
       > ./configure
       > make
       > make install

#### Access Rights
- To enable the access to the Nucleo USB device via stlink tools as
  non-privileged user, add a `udev` rule
  `49-stlinkv2-1.rules` to `etc/udev/rules.d` with the content shown below.
  Root access may be rquired.

        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="374b", \
            MODE:="0666", \
            SYMLINK+="stlinkv2-1_%n"

- Set the rights to `644`:

        > chmod 644 49-stlinkv2-1.rules

- Reload the udev rules by executing

        > udevadm control --reload-rules

- Unplug and reconnect the USB cable again

### Install precompiled stlink tools on Windows

See https://github.com/texane/stlink/wiki for pre-built Windows binaries and
install   the package to **C:\\MinGW** (or set your environment variables
accordingly).

### Build stlink tools on Windows

This section gives details on how to compile the **stlink** tools on
Windows with **MinGw**:

- Download the following packages and extract the archive contents to `C:\MinGW`

  * http://win32builder.gnome.org/packages/3.6/glib_2.34.3-1_win32.zip
  * http://win32builder.gnome.org/packages/3.6/pkg-config_0.28-1_win32.zip
  * http://win32builder.gnome.org/packages/3.6/pkg-config-dev_0.28-1_win32.zip

- Get the stlink project by downloading and extracting the source archive or
   get it from github:

        > $ git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git stlink-utility

- Investigate the file INSTALL.mingw and execute each step.
   Basically the following steps need to be carried out:

        > cd STLINK_DIR
        > ./autogen.sh
        > ./configure --prefix=/mingw
        > make
        > make install

   * If `./configure` fails with
     *PKG_CHECK_MODULES USB unexpected token!*
     Add the line: *ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I /mingw/share/aclocal* to the
     file **Makefile.am**.

> **Note:** The stlink tools rely on libusb to access the ST-LINK/V2.
> Older versions of libusb have trouble accessing ST-LINK/V2 debug adaptors
> when they are connected to an USB 3.0 port (even with an USB 2.0 hub in
> between). In this case the error message "Couldn't find any ST-Link/V2
> devices" will be shown.
> To solve this issue, a newer version of libusb has to be used.
> Version 1.0.19 has been tested to be successful.
>
> See files INSTALL in libusb sources and INSTALL.mingw in the stlink
> sources for building libusb.

> **stlink build issues for Windows:**
> To fix errors like *"In file included from gdbserver/gdb-remote.c:13:0:
> ./mingw/mingw.h:68:20: error: conflicting types for 'sleep'
> static inline void sleep(unsigned ms) { Sleep(ms); }"*:
> Comment out the line `static inline void sleep(unsigned ms) { Sleep(ms); }`
> in the file **stlink_PATH/mingw/mingw.h** and
> build stlink tools again.


## HAL Library {#sect_gs_install_software_hallib}
