\section sect_dualsn_impl_xcom uP-Master <-> uP-Slave cross communication
The cross communication between the two safe processors is carried out by using
the UART serial device.

\subsection sect_dualsn_impl_xcom_checks Cross communication checks
Additionally the following checks are performed during the uP-Master <-> uP-Slave
cross communication:
1. Both processors exchange their current program flow counter and compare it to
   their local value.
2. Both processors exchange the CRC of the subframe of the other processor. This
   means that the uP-Master forwards the CRC of sub2 to uP-Slave. uP-Slave uses
   this CRC to verify the frame locally before this subframe is discarded.
3. The clock drift of the consecutive time of both processors needs to be compensated.
   Therefore uP-Master and uP-Slave always exchange their current value of the
   64bit timebase. With the received value and the current local time an average
   time is calculated. This average time is then used as a basis for the
   consecutive time in the whole cycle.

\subsection sect_dualsn_impl_xcom_msg Cross communication messages
The cross communication checks are enabled by exchanging a message from the
uP-Master to the uP-Slave and back. This message exchange is done synchronously.
The format of the message from the uP-Master to the uP-Slave is defined by the
type \ref tXComMaSlImage. The message back is defined by \ref tXComSlMaImage.
