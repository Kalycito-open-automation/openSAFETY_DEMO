\section sect_singlesn_impl Single channel - Implementation details

The single channelled SN demo is a slightly simpler application than the
dual channelled SN demo.

The SN demo source code is located in the folder **app/demo-sn-gpio** where the
openSAFETY protocol stack implementation is located in the
folder **openSAFETY**.

The openSAFETY stack itself basically creates the openSAFETY frames which need
to be forwarded to the underlying fieldbus. The SN demo firmware is put together
by the following software modules:

- \ref group_app_sn_shnf

    The SHNF module implements the frame forwarding from and to the openSAFETY
    stack. It receives the openSAFETY payload from the underlying HNF receive
    channel and forwards the payload to the protocol stack. The SHNF does this
    without any further investigation of the payload itself.
    After a frame reception the SHNF then triggeres the build of new transmit data
    which is the forwarded to the HNF transmit channel.

- \ref module_sn_shnf_hnfpsi

    This module is part of the actual SHNF implementation and acts as a wrapper
    module of the SHNF to the libpsi. If the SN firmware shall be used with a different
    interface than the PSI an other implementation of this wrapper would be needed.
    The header demo-sn-gpio/shnf/include/shnf/hnf.h provides the interface from
    the SHNF to the hnfpsi.

- \ref group_app_sn_sapl

    The SAPL module implements all parts of the firmware which are close to the
    the user application or the SOD. It handles the parsing of the parameter stream
    which is downloaded to object **0x101A** on bootup.
    In addition the CRC32 calculation over the SOD is carried out by this module.
    If there is an implementation for the NVM on the selected target platform
    the SAPL also provides the possibility to store the content of the SOD to the
    local flash.
