The logbook module provides one or more channels to transfer logging information
to the Automation Studio Logger. The communication inside this channel is handled
like it is specified in the "openSAFETY over POWERLINK" specification and therefore
this module is only usable for openSAFETY applications. It implements the objects
LOGStub for transmission of the logger data. The configuration of of the channel
is handled via the app/demo-sn-gpio/config/tbuf/include/config/logbook.h header.

\section log_channel Logbook transmit channel

The transmit channel uses the LOGStubAddress_U32 (Object 2403h) for the destination
target of the data to send. If data is written from the local application to the
transmit channel of the POWERLINK processor the target information from the SSDOStub
is used to forward the transmit data to the target node index and subindex. The
internal memory layout of the transmit buffer is defined via the \ref tTbufLogStructure.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
typedef struct {
    UINT8        seqNr_m;
    tLogFormat   logData_m;
} PACK_STRUCT tTbufLogStructure;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the type \ref tLogChanNum to adjust the number of logbook channel. For SN
demos this is typically one.

\section log_interface User interface

The logbook module inside the PSI library provides an API for easy access to the
transmit data. Use the following functions to work with the logger module:
- \ref log_create
- \ref log_destroy
- \ref log_process
- \ref log_getCurrentLogBuffer
- \ref log_postLogEntry
