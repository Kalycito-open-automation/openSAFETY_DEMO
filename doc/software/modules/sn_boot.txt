\section sect_dualsn_impl_bootup Boot-up handshake
In order to enable a synchronized bootup, a handshake is performed between both
safe processors. This handshake is carried out in the following way:

1. The uP-Master boots up and waits for the **welcome** message from the uP-Slave.
2. uP-Slave boots up and sends the **welcome** message
3. uP-Master restores it's local SOD from NVM when both processors have a valid image
4. uP-Master sends the **response** message
5. uP-Slave receives the **response** message and also restores the local SOD
6. uP-Slave sends the **sync** message
7. On **sync** receive the uP-Master waits for the first sync IR from the PCP
8. uP-Master receives the sync IR and sends the **ready** message.
9. uP-Slave receives the **ready** message

\b -> Both processors boot up synchronously!
